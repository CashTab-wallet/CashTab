## What Is eCash (XEC)?
eCash (XEC) is the rebranded version of Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA), itself a fork of Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). It calls itself a “cryptocurrency that’s designed to be used as electronic cash.” eCash strictly aims to be a means of transaction used to pay for goods and services. 

## What Makes eCash Unique?
The developers of eCash (XEC) intend the coin to support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatibility and to be interoperable with the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector on Ethereum (ETH). For the coin to become successful, eCash’s developers intend to fulfill five core missions:

- Ensuring anonymous transactions
- Ensuring the immutability of transactions
- Guaranteeing that transactions remain almost free
- Enforcing globally secure transactions with a finality of fewer than three seconds
- Designing the coin’s infrastructure as a public good, funded via its social contract

To achieve this, the developers of eCash have laid out an ambitious roadmap, with plans to have:

- Canonical transaction ordering to enable scalable block processing
- Schnorr Signatures to enable batched signature validation
- Faster block propagation through graphene or other
- UTXO commitment with blockchain pruning and faster initial sync
- Merklix-Meta Tree to enable scalable block processing
- Adaptive block sizes to support market-driven growth to 1TB blocks
